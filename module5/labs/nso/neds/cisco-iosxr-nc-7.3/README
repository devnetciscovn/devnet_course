This NED supports the UM-preferred-super-set YANG library, and has
been verified with the following device families:

  - asr9000
  - ncs5500
  - xrv9000

Known issues:

  The interface model contains support for preconfigured interfaces.
  This means that an interface can change state from "pre" to "act"
  e.g. when some required hardware is plugged into the device. Such
  out-of-band change will render NSO out of sync with the device, and
  requires e.g. a subsequent NSO sync-from to synchronize.

  To avoid this, preconfigured interfaces should not be used. This
  also means that when configuring an <active>act</active> interface,
  all hardware requirements must be fulfilled, otherwise the interface
  will transform to <active>pre</active>.
